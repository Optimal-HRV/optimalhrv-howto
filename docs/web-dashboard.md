# Instructions - Optimal HRV Web Dashboard

The Optimal HRV Web Dashboard allows professionals, coaches, and managers to track an individual and group’s HRV and HRV training. Organizational owners get free access to the Optimal HRV app.

> Note : Only subscribed users get access

## Accessing the Web Dashboard

We provide two options for setting up a group and accessing the dashboard. Both options start with the owner setting up their group using this 'Organizational setup request' form. You can find the form [here](https://forms.wix.com/101291ad-5efa-411f-be67-bdc49fa9444a:e9bec8f2-9baa-45fc-a3d6-4c740d66f137).

- `Option 1`:
  - The organizational owner will then have their Users subscribe to the Optimal HRV app using their usual email account.
  - Users will then need to send an email from the associated email account to support@optimalhrv.com telling us which organization should get access to their data. Please supply the organization's name and organizational owner (i.e., this may be the manager, coach, or clinician).
- `Option 2`:
  - The organizational owner signs users up directly through the Dashboard.
  - Optimal HRV will invoice the owner $4.99 per month per dashboard user.

You can log in to your dashboard once you have an organizational account. The link to the dashboard is found in the top right-hand corner at https://www.optimalhrv.com

</div>

The link will take you to the web dashboard login page. Once we set you up as an owner, the login information that gets you into the smartphone app will give you access to your dashboard.

## Organizational Dashboard Home Page

The first page you will see after login is the organizational dashboard. This page has two components.

1. Collective information for everyone in your organization.
2. A list of groups (that you create) and information from those groups.

Notes:

- Population norms for groups are figured by averaging the population information for everyone’s demographics in that group (gender and age).
- Unless you change it. The Default group contains all the people in your organization.

You can click on a group to get information on the group and the individuals within that group.

</div>

The left menu bar:

<img src="./images/web-dashboard/navBar.png" align="left" height="320"/>

    - Dashboard: Takes you back to the organizational dashboard

    - Groups: Links to a page with a list of groups and allows you to create new groups

    - Users: Links to a page with a list of individuals users and allows you to add new users

    - Invite Users: Links to a page where you can invite new users to the platform

    - Reports: Links to a data-rich page for detailed information on user HRV

    - Billing History: Provides a record of all invoices associated with your organization’s subscription.

## Creating New Users

Follow the steps below to manually add new users through the Organizational Dashboard:

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard**  
   Ensure you are on the main page of the Organizational Dashboard.

2. **Open the Users Page**  
   Click the **Users** icon from the left-hand menu.

3. **Add a New User**  
   Click the **Add User** button to open the user setup form.

4. **Fill in User Details**

   - **Name**: Enter the full name of the user.
   - **Username**: Create a username that resembles an email address. It does not need to be a real email — it is used as a unique login identifier.
   - **Password**: Set a secure temporary password for the user.
   - **Date of Birth**: If unknown, enter today’s date as a placeholder.
   - **Gender**: If unknown, select `Other`.

5. **Assign User to Groups (Optional)**  
   Now assign users to specific groups. Group admins have access to manage users within their groups and view corresponding HRV data.

6. **Communicate Login Credentials**  
   Share the username and password with the user securely.  
   Instruct the user to:
   - Log in using the provided credentials.
   - Visit their **Profile** page in the app.
   - Update their date of birth, gender, and change their password.

---

**Bulk User Import**

If you're adding a large number of users:

- Email [support@optimalhrv.com](mailto:support@optimalhrv.com) and request an Excel import template.
- Fill out the required fields in the spreadsheet and send it back for batch upload.

---

**Notes**

- Each user must have a unique username.
- The date of birth and gender are used to calculate population norms for HRV comparisons.
- Users can be added to groups later from the **Groups** section.

---

**Troubleshooting: Email Already Exists**

If you receive an error indicating the username or email already exists, it means the user is already registered in the Optimal HRV system.  
Due to security and privacy reasons, organizational admins **cannot directly add users who already have an account**.  
Instead, use the **Invite User** page to send them an invitation. If the user accepts the invite, you will gain access to their HRV data through your organization.

<div align=center>
<img width="450" src="./images/web-dashboard/usersPage.png"/>
<img width="400" src="./images/web-dashboard/addUser.png"/>
<img width="450" src="./images/web-dashboard/addUserGroup.png"/>
</div>

## Inviting Existing Users

You can invite users to join your organization instead of adding them manually.

1. **Open the Invite Users Page**  
   From the Organizational Dashboard, navigate to the **Invite Users** page in the left-hand menu.

2. **Click the Invite User Button**  
   At the top of the page, click the **Invite User** button. This opens a dialog with the following fields:

   - **First Name**: Enter the user’s first name.
   - **Last Name**: Enter the user’s last name.
   - **Group**: Select the group you want this user to join.
   - **Email**: Enter the user’s existing email address (must match the one they used to register).
   - **Role**: Choose the user’s role within your organization using one of the following radio buttons:
     - **Organization Admin**
     - **Group Admin**
     - **User**

3. **Send the Invite**  
   Click the **Send Invite** button in the dialog. This sends an email with a secure link inviting the user to join your organization.

<div align=center>
<img height="300" width="460" src="./images/web-dashboard/inviteEmail.png"/>
</div>

When the user clicks the link:

- They are redirected to the login screen.
- They can log in using their existing account or create a new one.
- Once logged in, they will be added to your organization with the selected role and group access.

**Invited Users Table**

A table listing all invited users along with their current status:

- **Pending**: The user has not yet accepted the invitation.
- **Accepted**: The user has accepted the invitation and is now part of your organization.

You can monitor and manage invitations from this table at any time.

## Users Management Page

**Path:** Organization > Users  
**Purpose:** This page is the central hub for administrators to view, manage, and analyze all users within their organization. It provides both high-level metrics and a detailed, actionable list for comprehensive user administration.  
**Primary User Role:** Organization Administrators.

---

#### Page Overview

The Users page combines a dashboard of key metrics with a powerful, sortable, and searchable data table. It is the starting point for all user-related administrative tasks, from auditing activity to onboarding new members.

---

#### User Summary Metrics (Top Section)

At the top of the page, you will see a quick overview of user counts in your organization:

- **Active Users** – The number of users currently using the platform.
- **Internal Users** – Members of your organization (e.g., staff, team).
- **External Users** – Invited users outside your organization (e.g., clients, partners).
- **Total Users** – Sum of internal and external users.

#### Global Action Buttons

- **IMPORT:** Initiates a bulk user import process, typically via a CSV file upload. This is efficient for onboarding large teams.
- **+ ADD NEW:** Opens a dialog or form to manually create a single new user account.

---

#### Users Data Table

The core of the page is a detailed table listing every user in the organization. The table can be sorted by clicking on column headers and is filtered using the search bar.

**Search Bar:** The `Search users...` field allows you to quickly find users by their name, email, or other attributes.

#### Users Table Columns

| Column                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**               | The full name of the user. This is the primary identifier.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Email**              | The user's primary email address. This field may be hidden for some users due to privacy settings.                                                                                                                |
| **User type**          | The classification of the user. `Internal` denotes a standard employee, `Admin` is an internal user with elevated privileges, and `External` is a user from outside the organization (e.g., a client or partner). |
| **Last activity**      | The timestamp of the user's most recent action in the system. A default date (e.g., 1 Jan 1900) indicates a user who has never been active.                                                                       |
| **Last activity type** | The category of the last recorded action (e.g., "Login"). `N/A` indicates that no activity has been recorded for the user.                                                                                        |
| **Signup date**        | The date the user account was officially created. This is a reliable metric for tracking onboarding.                                                                                                              |
| **Payer**              | Defines the entity responsible for the user's billing. `Org` means the organization is billed, while `User` means the individual is responsible for payment.                                                      |
| **Actions**            | Contains an icon menu for user management operations, such as **Edit** (to modify details and permissions) and **Delete** (to permanently remove the user).                                                       |

---

#### Common Use Cases

#### 1. Onboarding a New Team

**Goal:** Add a department of 20 new employees.
**Action:** Use the **IMPORT** function to upload a CSV file with all user details instead of creating each account individually.

#### 2. Auditing User Engagement

**Goal:** Identify inactive accounts to free up licenses.
**Action:** Scan the **Last activity** column for outdated timestamps or placeholder dates (`1 Jan 1900`). Use the **Actions** menu to deactivate or delete these users.

#### 3. Managing External Collaboration

**Goal:** Review and manage access for external partners.
**Action:** Note the **EXTERNAL USERS** count. Filter the table by `External` user type to see all partners and review their **Last activity** to ensure access is still needed.

#### 4. Promoting a User to Administrator

**Goal:** Grant a trusted user full administrative capabilities.
**Action:**

1. Locate the user in the table.
2. Click the **Edit** action in their row.
3. In the Edit User form, check the **"Organization Admin"** option.
4. Upon saving, their **User type** in this table will update from `Internal` to `Admin`.

#### 5. Investigating Billing

**Goal:** Understand who is responsible for paying for user licenses.
**Action:** Review the **Payer** column. A high number of `Org` users means the company bears most costs. `User` indicates a bring-your-own-license model.

## Adding Users to a Group

This guide explains how **Organization Admins** and **Group Admins** can add or assign users to a group in the system. Note: Adding _new_ users creates fresh accounts, while assigning _existing_ users moves or adds them to groups without duplication.

#### 📌 Navigation Tips

- The **Users** and **Groups** pages are available in the **left sidebar** of your dashboard.
- You can **switch between organizations or groups** using the **dropdown menu** located at the **top-right corner** of the header section.
- Button labels may vary slightly (e.g., "Add User" vs. "+ Add New") based on your dashboard version—functionality remains the same.

👉 For detailed instructions on switching between organizations or groups, refer to our guide: [Switching Organizations or Groups](#switching-organizations-or-groups).

---

#### 👤 Adding New Users to a Group (For Group Admins)

If you're a **Group Admin**, follow these steps to add a brand-new user directly to your group:

1. Go to your **Group Dashboard** (switch if needed via top-right dropdown).
2. From the **left sidebar**, navigate to the **Users** page.
3. Click the **`Add User`** or **`+ Add New`** button at the top-right (or top-left) corner.
4. Fill in the required user details (Name, Username, Password, Date of Birth, Gender).
5. In the **Assign to Groups** section (optional but recommended here), select your group.
6. Click **Submit**.

> ✅ Group Admins can manage users directly within their assigned group. See [Creating New Users](#creating-new-users) for more details on user fields.

<div align=center>
<img width="450" src="./images/web-dashboard/groupUsersPage.png"/>
<img width="350" src="./images/web-dashboard/addGroupUser.png"/>
</div>

---

#### 🏢 Adding New Users to a Group (For Organization Admins)

Organization Admins cannot add users directly from the org-level dashboard. Here's how:

1. From your **Org Admin Dashboard**, go to the **Groups** page in the **left sidebar**.
2. **Click on the group** you want to manage. This will **automatically switch you to that group’s dashboard**.
3. In the **left sidebar**, navigate to the **Users** page.
4. Click the **`Add User`** or **`+ Add New`** button at the top-right (or top-left) corner.
5. Enter the user details and select the group if prompted.
6. Click **Submit**.

> ℹ️ Note: Org Admins must **switch to a group's dashboard** before adding users. We recognize this is not ideal and are working on a future update for direct assignment without switching.

<div align=center>
<img width="450" src="./images/web-dashboard/usersPage.png"/>
<img width="350" src="./images/web-dashboard/addUser.png"/>
</div>

---

#### 🔄 Assigning Existing Users to a Group

To add or move an _existing_ user (already in your organization) to a group:

1. From the **Organizational Dashboard**, click the **Users** icon in the left-hand menu to view all users.
2. Locate the user in the list (e.g., search or scroll).
3. Click the **pencil icon** (edit button) on the far right of their row. (See [Action Buttons on the Users Page](#action-buttons-on-the-users-page) for more.)
4. In the popup:
   - Review or skip the top fields (Name, Username, etc.).
   - Below these, find the **dropdown menu** for groups.
   - Select one or more groups to assign.
5. Click **Update** or **Save**.

6. Verify: Go to the group's page and confirm the user appears. Their HRV data should now be visible in the group context.

<div align=center>
<img width="400" src="./images/web-dashboard/editUser.png"/> <!-- Reuse existing image; add one showing group dropdown if possible -->
</div>

> ✅ This method works for both Org and Group Admins. If the user isn't visible, ensure they've accepted any invites (see [Inviting Existing Users](#inviting-existing-users)).

---

#### 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **No "Add User" button?** Look for "+ Add New" instead—it's the same function.
- **User not appearing in group after assignment?** Refresh the page, switch groups via dropdown, or check if they're pending (e.g., unaccepted invite).
- **Can't see individual data?** Users must be in a group and have taken readings. Check last use under the main Dashboard.
- **Error or missing dropdown?** Contact support@optimalhrv.com with screenshots. Ensure you're an admin with proper permissions.
- For bulk changes, email support for an Excel template (see [Bulk User Import](#creating-new-users)).

## Switching Organizations or Groups

At the top bar of any page in the Organizational Dashboard, you'll find a dropdown displaying the **current organization or group name**.

<div align=center>
<img height="360" width="300" src="./images/web-dashboard/changeOrg.png"/>
</div>

**How It Works**

- This dropdown allows users with the appropriate permissions to switch between different organizations or groups.
- If the user is an **Organization Admin**, clicking the dropdown will reveal a list of all organizations and groups they have access to.
- Selecting a different organization or group from the list will update the dashboard view to reflect the selected context.

This feature is especially helpful for admins managing multiple groups or organizations under a single account.

## Billing History Page

The **Billing History** page provides a record of all invoices associated with your organization’s subscription. Admins can view past billing activity, check the current payment status, and download invoices for accounting or compliance purposes.

**Accessing the Billing History Page**

- From the Organizational Dashboard, click the **Billing History** icon in the left-hand navigation menu.

<div align=center>
<img width="750" src="./images/web-dashboard/billingHistory.png"/>
</div>

---

#### Page Overview

The page consists of two main sections:

1. **User Summary Metrics (Top Section)**  
   At the top of the page, you will see a quick overview of user counts in your organization:

   - **Active Users** – The number of users currently using the platform.
   - **Internal Users** – Members of your organization (e.g., staff, team).
   - **External Users** – Invited users outside your organization (e.g., clients, partners).
   - **Total Users** – Sum of internal and external users.

   > These counts help you confirm that your subscription matches the number of users in your organization.

2. **Billing Records Table (Main Section)**  
   A detailed table lists all invoices with the following columns:

   | Column             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Billing Email**  | The email address linked to the invoice recipient.                                                                                                                                                            |
   | **Status**         | The current invoice status: <br> - **Paid**: The invoice has been paid.<br> - **Invoice Sent**: The invoice has been issued but is not yet paid.                                                              |
