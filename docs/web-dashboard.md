# Instructions - Optimal HRV Web Dashboard

The Optimal HRV Web Dashboard allows professionals, coaches, and managers to track an individual and groupâ€™s HRV and HRV training. Organizational owners get free access to the Optimal HRV app.

> Note : Only subscribed users get access

## Accessing the Web Dashboard

We provide two options for setting up a group and accessing the dashboard. Both options start with the owner setting up their group using this 'Organizational setup request' form. You can find the form [here](https://forms.wix.com/101291ad-5efa-411f-be67-bdc49fa9444a:e9bec8f2-9baa-45fc-a3d6-4c740d66f137).

- `Option 1`:
    - The organizational owner will then have their Users subscribe to the Optimal HRV app using their usual email account.
    - Users will then need to send an email from the associated email account to setup@optimalhrv.com telling us which organization should get access to their data. Please supply the organization's name and organizational owner (i.e., this may be the manager, coach, or clinician).
- `Option 2`:
    - The organizational owner signs users up directly through the Dashboard.
    - Optimal HRV will invoice the owner $4.99 per month per dashboard user.

You can log in to your dashboard once you have an organizational account. The link to the dashboard is found in the top right-hand corner at https://www.optimalhrv.com

The link will take you to the web dashboard login page. Once we set you up as an owner, the login information that gets you into the smartphone app will give you access to your dashboard.
