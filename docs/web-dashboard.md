# Instructions - Optimal HRV Web Dashboard

The Optimal HRV Web Dashboard allows professionals, coaches, and managers to track an individual and group’s HRV and HRV training. Organizational owners get free access to the Optimal HRV app.

> Note : Only subscribed users get access

## Accessing the Web Dashboard

We provide two options for setting up a group and accessing the dashboard. Both options start with the owner setting up their group using this 'Organizational setup request' form. You can find the form [here](https://forms.wix.com/101291ad-5efa-411f-be67-bdc49fa9444a:e9bec8f2-9baa-45fc-a3d6-4c740d66f137).

- `Option 1`:
  - The organizational owner will then have their Users subscribe to the Optimal HRV app using their usual email account.
  - Users will then need to send an email from the associated email account to setup@optimalhrv.com telling us which organization should get access to their data. Please supply the organization's name and organizational owner (i.e., this may be the manager, coach, or clinician).
- `Option 2`:
  - The organizational owner signs users up directly through the Dashboard.
  - Optimal HRV will invoice the owner $4.99 per month per dashboard user.

You can log in to your dashboard once you have an organizational account. The link to the dashboard is found in the top right-hand corner at https://www.optimalhrv.com

## Organizational Dashboard Home Page

The first page you will see after login is the organizational dashboard. This page has two components.

1. Collective information for everyone in your organization.
2. A list of groups (that you create) and information from those groups.

Notes:

- Population norms for groups are figured by averaging the population information for everyone’s demographics in that group (gender and age).
- Unless you change it. The Default group contains all the people in your organization.

You can click on a group to get information on the group and the individuals within that group.

  - The right menu allows you to choose whether each reading is displayed separately or if you want an average of daily readings, for example.
