# What is HRV?

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) provides a research-backed method for measuring the health of a personâ€™s nervous system and is an indicator of overall physical, mental, and social health.

HRV is the variability between successive heartbeats over a period of time. Where heart rate measures the average number of beats per minute, HRV concerns the intervals between each beat.

# What is Biofeedback?

Using Biofeedback is a way to change your health with a mindfulness response, combating stressors and other stimuli. 

The physiological process of HRV can be accurately measured using the Optimal HRV app, however with the Biofeedback training modules, you can learn to modify your physiological responses in ways beneficial to your health.
