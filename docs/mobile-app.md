## 2. Daily HRV Tracking

_Use Case: "I want to track my HRV daily to monitor my health"_

### Taking Morning Readings

Morning readings provide a **consistent baseline** for overall health and wellness. Here's how to take them:

1. **Prepare**: Place your Bluetooth device next to your phone, alarm clock, or another place that will remind you to take a morning reading
2. **Connect**: Follow the [device connection steps](#connecting-your-hrv-device) above
3. **Take the Reading**: The reading will automatically start once your device is connected
4. **During the Reading**:
   - You'll see a chart displaying your heart rate and a timer
   - **Breathe normally** - These readings give you a snapshot of how you're doing. Controlling your breath could change the results
   - **Keep your position consistent** - Your body position can influence your HRV. Sit comfortably during the reading and use this same position every time

Morning readings are typically **3 minutes long** (though you can adjust this in settings). The "Morning" tag will be automatically applied.

### Taking Anytime Readings

Anytime readings can be taken **anytime throughout the day** to:

- Track your HRV at different times
- Experiment with how specific activities, therapies, and events influence your HRV
- Compare pre and post-activity HRV changes

The process is the same as morning readings - connect your device and let the reading run. You can add tags to indicate what you were doing or how you were feeling.

### Adding Tags and Notes

After completing a Morning or Anytime Reading, you can add:

- **Tags**: Time of day, emotional state, events, and substances
- **Custom Tags**: Create your own tags to track specific patterns (see [Customizing Your Experience](#_7-customizing-your-experience))
- **Notes**: Add written notes about the reading

Tags help you identify patterns and understand what affects your HRV. Morning readings automatically include the "Morning" tag.

## 3. Finding Your Resonance Frequency

_Use Case: "I want to determine my ideal breathing rate for training"_

### What is Resonance Frequency (RF) Assessment?

The **Resonance Frequency Assessment** determines your ideal breathing rate - the rate that will optimize your breathing, mindfulness, and self-compassion training. This is **your personal optimal breathing rate**.

**Important Facts**:

- Your breathing rate does **not change after age 13**
- No rate is better than another - it's **YOUR best rate**
- You only need to take the assessment **once** (unless you're under 20, then repeat once per year)
- The assessment is appropriate for **ages 13 and up**

### When to Take the RF Assessment

- **First time users**: Take this before starting biofeedback training
- **Age 13-20**: Repeat once per year as your body develops
- **Age 20+**: Once is enough - your RF rate won't change

### Completing the RF Assessment

1. **Select Your Age Group**: The app will show you the most suitable assessment for your age
2. **Follow the Guide**: The assessment will guide you through multiple 2-minute breathing exercises
3. **Stay Focused**:
   - Ensure your sensor is attached for the duration
   - Limit your movement
   - Focus on the pacer
   - The assessment takes about 14 minutes (with pauses between different breathing rates)
4. **Get Your Results**: At the end, you'll see your ideal breathing rate (RF rate) that you'll use for all future biofeedback training

<div align=center>

## 6. Understanding Your Data

_Use Case: "I want to understand what my HRV data means"_

### Understanding RMSSD

Optimal HRV uses **RMSSD** (Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences) for Morning and Anytime Readings. RMSSD is one of the best-researched HRV metrics to measure the resiliency and health of the nervous system.

**Key Point**: `The higher the HRV score, the better!`

### Reading Your Results Page

After completing a reading, you'll see several metrics:

#### Latest

The results of the reading you just completed or your most recent reading.

#### Previous

Your HRV score from the second most recent reading. This allows you to compare:

- **Pre-test**: Your Previous reading (before an activity)
- **Post-test**: Your Latest reading (after an activity)

Use this to see how activities (workouts, sleep, work, therapy, mindfulness) impact your HRV.

#### Last Week

An average of your HRV scores over the **last seven days**. This provides insight into how you're doing this week.

#### Last Month

An average of your HRV scores over the **last 30 days**. Compare this to your weekly and daily scores to see which direction your health is trending.

#### All Time

The average of **all your HRV scores**. This is your baseline for comparison.

**Goal**: Improve or maintain your All Time average over time. Ideally, your Last Week and Last Month averages should be above your All Time average.

#### Population

The average HRV score for your age and gender. This is provided **only for informational purposes**.

> **Important**: Many factors influence HRV, including genetics. `The goal is to improve and maintain your All Time Average over time and not worry about the population norms`.

<div align=center>
<img height="450" src="./images/mobile-app/mobile_anytime.jpg"/>
</div>

### Advanced Metrics Explained

When viewing reading or training session details, you'll see additional metrics:
